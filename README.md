Course Summary

This course covers methods for organizing your code, both conceptually and literally. You’ll learn the importance of 
separating concerns when writing JavaScript, gaining hands-on experience along the way. Separating concerns can be 
done with or without an organizational library or framework. We’ll learn how to separate concerns without one, and 
then we’ll explore an organizational library together. You’ll also learn strategies for exploring other libraries 
and frameworks on your own.

By the end of this course, you’ll understand (from experience) the importance of code organization, and how to 
implement it with either vanilla JavaScript or an organizational library or framework. Your applications will 
start looking clean and professional—not just to your users, but also to anyone who looks at the code driving 
your applications.
